# Pattern-Based-Insider-Threat-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

The proposed insider threat detection tool is designed for conventional IT infrastructures, such as monolithic applications, standalone servers, or centralized enterprise systems. These environments, while more static than modern microservice-based systems, still face significant risks from insider threats due to privileged access, poor audit practices, and limited real-time visibility.

To address these issues, the tool applies a hybrid detection methodology that combines Machine Learning (ML) techniques with rule-based logic to identify malicious behavior patterns in system and network activity logs.

# Detection Methodology
The system uses historical log data generated from traditional IT systemsâ€”such as user login records, file access logs, network flow data, and system alertsâ€”to identify insider threats. The detection framework includes:

ðŸ”¸â€‚Tree-Based ML Models:

XGBoost: Identifies sophisticated threat patterns and correlations between user activities and anomalies.

Isolation Forest: Detects abnormal instances in system behavior by isolating outliers in high-dimensional data.

ðŸ”¸â€‚Autoencoder Networks:

Learns patterns of normal behavior and flags significant deviations that may indicate compromised or malicious insiders.

ðŸ”¸â€‚Rule-Based Logic:

Uses expert-defined rules to detect known violations (e.g., login attempts outside business hours, unauthorized file access, excessive admin commands).

This combination ensures the detection of both unknown anomaly patterns and predefined suspicious behaviors.

# Simulated Dashboard for Demonstration
A Streamlit-based interface has been developed to simulate the detection workflow. Although it does not support real-time log uploads, it enables visualization and testing of the toolâ€™s capabilities using preloaded datasets. 

The dashboard:

- Loads traditional log datasets that replicate common enterprise system activity.

- Allows manual triggering of the detection engine.

Displays:

- Number of alerts generated.

- IDs or usernames of users involved in flagged activities.

- Descriptions summarizing the suspicious actions.

This interface serves as a proof-of-concept for security analysts to understand how ML and rule-based detection could be used in real-world settings.

# Relevance and Application in Traditional Systems
- The tool demonstrates the viability of integrating automated threat detection into existing security monitoring systems without requiring DevOps, containers, or CI/CD workflows.

- It is particularly useful for legacy systems, on-premise servers, and environments that lack centralized orchestration tools.

- It strengthens internal threat visibility where SIEM systems may be unavailable or limited in analytical capabilities.

This detection framework provides a proactive and intelligent solution to detect insider threats in static or conventional IT infrastructures, offering scalable protection even in non-cloud-native contexts.

# Future Enhancements

- Real-Time Log Integration: Extend support for live ingestion from syslogs, Windows Event Logs, or SIEM connectors.

- User Behavior Profiling (UBA): Incorporate session-level analysis to better capture context-based anomalies.

- Alert Prioritization: Use risk-based scoring to rank incidents based on severity and asset criticality.

- Integration Ready: Design for plug-and-play compatibility with existing monitoring tools such as Splunk, ELK Stack, or custom dashboards.
